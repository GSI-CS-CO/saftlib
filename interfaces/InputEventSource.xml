<!-- de.gsi.saftlib.InputEventSource:
    @short_description: An input used to generate timing events
    
    An InputEventSource is also an EventSource and Owned.
    
    InputEventSources generate two events: high and low transition.
    These are encoded in the resulting event ID's lowest bit.

  <!-- StableTime: Deglitch threshold for the input
       The number of nanoseconds a signal must remain high or low in order
       to be considered a valid transition. Increasing this value will not
       impact the resulting timestamps, but will hide transitions smaller
       than the threshold. For example, if StableTime=400, then a 5MHz
       signal would be completely ignored.

  <!-- Termination: Set the input termination
       Some inputs need termination to receive a clean input signal. 
       However, if the same IO is used as an Output, termination should
       probably be disabled.  This defaults to on.  See also OutputEnable if
       this is an Inoutput.

  <!-- ReadInput: Read the current input value.
       For Inoutputs, this may differ from the Output value, if OutputEnable
       is false.  To receive a signal on Input changes, use the EventSource
       interface to create timing events and monitor these via a
       SoftwareActionSink.
