  <!-- de.gsi.saftlib.WbmActionSink:
      @short_description: An output through which Wbm actions flow.
      
      This inteface allows the generation of SCU timing events.
      A WbmActionSink is also an ActionSink and Owned.
      
      If two SoftwareConditions are created on the same SoftwareActionSink
      which require simultaneous delivery of two Actions, then they will be
      delivered in arbitrary order, both having the 'conflict' flag set.

    <!-- NewCondition: Create a condition to match incoming events
         @active: Should the condition be immediately active
         @id:     Event ID to match incoming event IDs against
         @mask:   Set of bits for which the event ID and id must agree
         @offset: Delay in nanoseconds between event and action
         @tag:    The  32-bit value to send on the Wbm
         @result: Object path to the created WbmCondition

         This method creates a new condition that matches events whose
         identifier lies in the range [id &amp; mask, id | ~mask].  The offset
         acts as a delay which is added to the event's execution timestamp
         to determine the timestamp when the matching condition fires its
         action.  The returned object path is a SCUBUSCondition object.
