  <!-- de.gsi.saftlib.TimingReceiver:
       @short_description: A timing receiver.
       
       Timing receivers can respond to timing events from the data master.
       The can also respond to external timing triggers via inputs.
       
       The general idea is that a TimingReceiver has ActionSinks to which it
       sends actions in response to incoming timing events. Timing events
       are matched with Conditions to create the Actions sent to the Sinks.
       
       EventSources are objects which create timing events, to be matched
       by the conditions. The data master is a global EventSource to which
       all TimingReceivers listen. However, external inputs can also be
       configured to generate timing events. Furthermore, a TimingReceiver
       can simulate the receipt of a timing event by calling the InjectEvent
       method.
       
       Timing receivers always typically have binary outputs lines
       (OutputActionSinks), which are listed in the Outputs property. 
       Similarly, they often have digital inputs (InputEventSources).
       
       Some timing receivers have special purpose interfaces. For example,
       an SCU has the SCUbusActionSink which generates 32-bit messages over
       the SCU backplane. These special interfaces can be found in the
       interfaces property. The SCU backplane would be found under the
       SCUbusActionSink key, and as there is only one, it would be the 0th.

         SoftwareActionSinks allow a program to create conditions that match
