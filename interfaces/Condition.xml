<!-- de.gsi.saftlib.Condition:
     @short_description: A rule matched against incoming events
     
     Conditions are created for ActionSinks to select which events the
     sink should respond to. Different ActionSinks return handles to 
     different Conditions. This interface is the common denominator.

<interface name="de.gsi.saftlib.Condition">
  <!-- ID: The event identifier which this condition matches against.
       An incoming event matches if its ID and this ID agree on all the bits
       set in this condition's Mask.
    -->
  <property name="ID" type="t" access="readwrite"/>
  
  <!-- Mask: The mask used when comparing event IDs.
       An incoming event matches if its ID and the ID property of this
       Condition agree on all the bits set in this Mask.

       An inactive condition is not used to match against events.
       You can toggle the active state of this condition via this property,
       or if multiple Conditions should be atomically adjusted, use the
       ToggleActive method on the ActionSink.
