<!-- de.gsi.saftlib.OutputActionSink:
    @short_description: An output through which on/off actions flow.
    
    This inteface allows the generation of Output pulses.
    An OutputActionSink is also an ActionSink and Owned.
    
    If two SoftwareConditions are created on the same SoftwareActionSink
    which require simultaneous delivery of two Actions, then they will be
    delivered in arbitrary order, both having the 'conflict' flag set.

  <!-- NewCondition: Create a condition to match incoming events
       @active: Should the condition be immediately active
       @first:  First event ID to monitor (inclusive)
       @last:   Last event ID to monitor (inclusive)
       @offset: Delay in nanoseconds between event and action
       @guards: The specified guard must be true 4us before action
       @on:     The output should be toggled on (or off)
       @result: Object path to the created OutputCondition

       This method creates a new condition that matches events whose
       identifier lies in the range [first, last]. The offset acts as a
       delay which is added to the event's execution timestamp to
       determine the timestamp when the matching condition fires its
       action. The returned object path is a OutputCondition object.
