  <!-- de.gsi.saftlib.WrMilGateway:
       @short_description: A converter for WhiteRabbit timing events to MIL.
     
       The WhiteRabbit-MIL-Gateway receives WhiteRabbit timing events, translates
       them into MIL timing events and outputs them with few microsecond accuracy.
       This device is needed to run SIS18 and ESR.
