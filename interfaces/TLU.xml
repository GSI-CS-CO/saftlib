       This D-Bus interface is used to control the Timestamp-Latch-Unit
       (TLU) hardware present in timing receivers. This interface merely
       reports the available TLU_Channels and provides the current time.

         This returns an array of object paths, each path has the format:
         /de/gsi/saftlib/TLU/[x]-[y]. [x] is the TLU device and [y] is the
         channel on that device.
