<!-- de.gsi.saftlib.OutputActionSink:
    @short_description: An output through which on/off actions flow.
    
    This inteface allows the generation of Output pulses.
    An OutputActionSink is also an ActionSink and Owned.
    
    If two SoftwareConditions are created on the same SoftwareActionSink
    which require simultaneous delivery of two Actions, then they will be
    delivered in arbitrary order, both having the 'conflict' flag set.

<interface name="de.gsi.saftlib.OutputActionSink">
  <!-- NewCondition: Create a condition to match incoming events
       @active: Should the condition be immediately active
       @id:     Event ID to match incoming event IDs against
       @mask:   Set of bits for which the event ID and id must agree
       @offset: Delay in nanoseconds between event and action
       @guards: The specified guard must be true 4us before action
       @on:     The output should be toggled on (or off)
       @result: Object path to the created OutputCondition

       This method creates a new condition that matches events whose
       identifier lies in the range [id & mask, id | ~mask].  The offset
       acts as a delay which is added to the event's execution timestamp to
       determine the timestamp when the matching condition fires its action. 
       The returned object path is a OutputCondition object.
