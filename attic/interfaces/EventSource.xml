<!-- de.gsi.saftlib.EventSource:
     @short_description: An external source of timing events.
     
     Normally, timing events come from the data master in the timing
     network.  However, external inputs to the timing receiver can also 
     be used as a source of timing events.  For example, a LEMO input
     can be configured to generate a timing event on edge transitions.
     
     When the external trigger occurs, it is timestamped and an event 
     is created which will be processed as normal by the timing receiver.
     The event identifier comes from the EventPrefix. However, some 
     external devices additionally provide data which is filled into the 
     low EventBits of the generated event identifier.
