<!-- de.gsi.saftlib.Device:
     @short_description: A device attached to saftd via Etherbone.
     
     Devices are attached to saftlib by specifying a name and a path.  The
     name should denote the logical relationship of the device to saftd. 
     For example, baseboard would be a good name for the timing receiver
     attached to an SCU.  If an exploder is being used to output events to
     an oscilloscope, a good logical name might be scope.  In these
     examples, the path for the SCU baseboard would be dev/wbm0, and the
     scope exploder would be dev/ttyUSB3 or similar.
     
     This scheme is intended to make it easy to hot-swap hardware. If the
     exploder dies, you can simply attach a new one under the same logical
     name, even though the path might be different.
